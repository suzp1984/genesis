Genesis
-------

A basic C middleware library of event-drivered framework
with whole plugins design inspired by [FTK](https://code.google.com/p/ftk/)
and [Pulseaudio](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/).

and also by [nginx](http://nginx.org/)


How to Compile
--------------

This project use Scons build system. So use scons to compile
and links the sources. The object files and target librarys
are all located in build directory.

How to run the test case
------------------------

There are many test cases in the test directory, after compile
the source code, the test case are all located in build/test 
directory. 

I provide a convenient tool to list and run selected or all 
test cases, it named run_test.sh, just located in top of 
the source tree. So enjoy it.
